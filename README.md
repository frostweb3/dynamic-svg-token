# Project setup

## Requirements
Make sure that you are using the node version `v14.17.0`.

## Clone the skale-demo repository
To run this example project, clone this project 
```
git clone https://github.com/skalenetwork/gaming-token-svg.git
```

## Install the NPM packages
Run the `npm install`.

## Setting of the env variables
Please contact Skale for the values of the env variables (except for contract address)
create a new `.env` file 
which contains 
```
ENDPOINT=http://exampleendpoint
PRIVATE_KEY=exampleprivatekey
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=examplecontractaddress
ABI_NAME=DynamicSvgToken-WithAddress.json
```

## Creating the private key
To create a new private key for the project, run the command
```
npm run createWallet
```
copy the private key from the output to the `.env` file as `PRIVATE_KEY`.

Also save the `Address` as you will need to send it to us in order to grand you access to contract deployments.

(Please don't send us your private keys)

## Compile and deploy contract
To compile the contract run 
```
npm run compile 
```
To deploy this contract run
```
npm run deploy
```
After running this command you will see an output like this example
```
ERC721 Token DynamicSvgToken was deployed
Address: 0x5bBf089e42af7711cbF299BcE945B6A0801c864f
```
Replace the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in the .env with the address from the output of the command

## Minting NFTs
To mint the NFTs run
```

```
Expect this script to take ~30 seconds.
Once done you can check the block explorer to see the NFTs minted.

The NFT token SVGs are being generated randomly via the `scripts/MintTokens.js` script.

You can view the minted NFTs and their SVG images by opening `result.html` file in your browser.
